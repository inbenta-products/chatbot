### Introduction

In this scenario, we have a new product, and we want to present it to  every user that interacts with the Chatbot SDK. We will show information about this new product in the conversation window, and we will open the side window with an image and a URL so they can see all the information.



The first step is to build the adapter. To follow best practices, we build it in an external js file.


More information related to the adapter can be found in https://developers.inbenta.io/chatbot/javascript-sdk/sdk-adapters/promotional-message
