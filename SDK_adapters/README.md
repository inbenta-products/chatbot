## Adapters overview
An adapter is a function that has access to the Chatbot object. Please read the [Customization](https://apidocs.inbenta.io/javascript-sdks/chatbot/sdk-customization)  page and our handy [Step-by-Step Guide](https://apidocs.inbenta.io/javascript-sdks/chatbot/sdk-customization/step-by-step-guide) carefully before use for a full description of adapters and their functions. 

## Adapters Guide
Adapters are a powerful tool that allow you to expand the functions and behaviour of your Inbenta Chatbot.

**Important:** The adapters provided by Inbenta are fully functional adapters that you can freely test "as is" or adapt for your own purposes. 

**Caution:** If you want to use external adapters "as is" in production environments, you must copy and use them from your servers. To avoid any potential issues, do not use the direct Inbenta links for Production, as Inbenta may change or update links or files without prior notice
