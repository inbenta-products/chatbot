# Introduction

This adapter shows a previously-created survey from the same project as the domain/secret key Chatbot SDK. 

When a user clicks on the "Close" button of the conversation window, the confirmation message appears. If they confirm that you want to leave the conversation, the survey then appears in the conversation window.
